Ratio Analysis: Calculated five key ratios to measure performance:

Liquidity: Current Ratio

Leverage: Debt-to-Equity Ratio

Profitability: Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Return on Equity (ROE)

Data Visualization: Created line and bar charts to clearly visualize trends in profitability and financial health over the three-year period.

üìà Key Findings

Strong Profitability: The company is highly profitable, with a stable Net Profit Margin of approximately 32-34%. This indicates strong operational efficiency.

Excellent Liquidity: The company is in a safe financial position. Its Current Ratio is consistently above 1.2, meaning it has more than enough liquid assets to cover all its short-term bills.
